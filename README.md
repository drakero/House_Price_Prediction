## Synopsis

Python code written to analyze the King County house sales dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction).
It is still a work in progress; currently there are some select visualizations of the data to see how various features of a home influence price. Some rudimentary regression was performed but needs further development.
