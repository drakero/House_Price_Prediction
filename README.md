## Synopsis

<p>Python code written to analyze the King County house sales dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction).
It is still a work in progress; currently there are some select visualizations of the data to see how various features of a home influence price. Simple regression methods were used (ordinary least squares and k-nearest neighbors) to achieve reasonable values for the testing error.</p>

<p>Improvements can be made by making use of the other features (e.g. yr_built, floors, etc.,  which were not analyzed here). Other regression models such as ridge regression could also be used.</p>
